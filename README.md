# Web Services and Applications Project

## Project Summary

The **Web Services and Applications Project**, authored by Céaman Collins, is a practical demonstration of creating and consuming RESTful APIs. 

## Project Description

This project involves building a pizza order and customer management system. Features include:
- Databases for storing orders and customer information with interconnectivity.
- User-friendly interfaces for customer registration and pizza ordering.
- Backend processing ensuring efficient operations split across six modular files.

## Technologies Used

The project incorporates the following technologies:
- **Python:** Backend development, including API handling and database integration.
- **Flask:** Lightweight web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **SQLite:** Database for managing customer and order data.
- **JavaScript:** Frontend logic, including asynchronous functions and dynamic interactions.
- **Highcharts:** Data visualization tool for creating interactive charts.
- **GitHub Copilot:** Assisted code generation and enhancement during development.
